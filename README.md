# :unicorn: [Venture Unicorns Networks](https://lzgzlwix8j42wl9s.vercel.app) 

A **Unicorn** is a company valued by at least 1 Billion USD. I previously built a python [gradio](https://leoncensh-networkx-saas.hf.space) app that visualizes relationships between venture capital firms and invested companies. With this app, I was able to show the dominance of the top 5 Venture capital firms **Y Combinator, Accel, Venrock, and Andreeseen Horowitz** owning companies with an aggregate valuation exceeding **$500 Billion USD!** Although private valuation can be misleading, the dominance by a few investors, and a few firms is undeniable. Companies like **SpaceX, Bytedance(Ticktok) and Databricks** take a significant percentage of the value. 

Some limitations of the Python gradio app were that the app doesn't render well on Mobile, with the network diagrams overlapping too much, which led to a poor user experience. 

To solve this rendering issue, I built a new version using **React**, which renders much better on mobile. This app serves dual purposes:

1. **For job hunters, it identifies companies with strong product-market fit backed by reputable investors** to target in their job search
   
2. **For startup founders, it highlights which investors support competitors, enabling refined pitch strategies**.
